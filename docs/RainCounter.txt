Rain counter

This is the RAINEW rain gauge by RainWise, with our 1-Wire Dual Counter installed. 
The 8" diameter collector meets National Weather Service (NWS) specifications for statistical accuracy. 
Every time the bucket tips, a count is transmitted to the counter device and the gauge empties. 
Unlike manual rain gauges, our tipping rain gauge never has to be emptied. 
Each tip of the bucket counts 0.01 inches (approximately 0.25 mm) of rain.
